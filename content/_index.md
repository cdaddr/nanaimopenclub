**Welcome to Nanaimo Pen Club!**  Founded in 2022, we're a group of fountain pen enthusiasts in Nanaimo, BC.  We gather in person to share our love of pens and ink with fellow pen-lovers.  Modern pens, vintage pens, we love them all!

## Meeting Details

* **Where**: [Common Foundry](https://www.commonfoundry.com/) in Nanaimo, BC. 
  ([map link](https://g.page/common-foundry?share))  There's street parking right outside, and a paid
  parking lot a block away if the street is unavailable.
* **When**: The first Thursday of every month, starting at 5pm.  Check our social media or join the
  mailing list for schedule updates.
* **Who**: All are welcome!  Pen-users, pen-collectors, artists, long-time hobbyists and curious
  beginners.  Whether you have zero pens, one pen, or dozens.

A typical club meeting might include:

* Introductions
* Show-and-tell - show off your new or favourite pens and inks!
* Monthly discussion topic
* Ink exchange

Mostly we hang out and socialize.  Our club is a very casual and welcoming group.  There are no membership fees or requirements.  Stop in and say hi!
